# ShamirSecretSharingScheme
Generates and decodes strings to be used with Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme

# How it works
A good explaination of the method is given on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing

# How to use it
Use CreatePass.py to create a password that will be split as many times as you'd like (at a max of the length of the string) and then use DecodePass.py to decode a complete list of these strings. If the list is incomplete, it will give a best guess.
